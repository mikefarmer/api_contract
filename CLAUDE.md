# Ruby gem `api_contract`

## Guidelines
This gem is just getting started but here are some initial guidelines.

The core concept for this gem is located in README.md

We want this gem to be useful to the general public so follow strict ruby practices including:
- Ruby 3.4+ support
- Latest Rubocop Standards
- Full test suite using RSpec
- All public methods and classes documented with YARD. Generated YARD documentation should live in this repository.

## REQUIRED
- Always run `rubocop -a` after changing a ruby file. If any issues are found and not auto-corrected, correct them.
